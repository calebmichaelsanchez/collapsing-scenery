Text: POGM was founded in August 2012 by Jeff and Carla McCool. Prior to that Pastor Jeff was a full time evangelist and traveled across the USA for 10 years preaching revivals and teaching evangelism seminars. 

The McCool’s have been in active ministry for 37 years and started out to preach their first revival just two weeks after they were married. They have also pastored churches in Chattanooga Tennessee, Sikeston Missouri and Terre Haute Indiana.

Pastor Jeff comes from an Apostolic/Pentecostal background and remains true to his roots but with a progressive approach and passion to engage community and culture for the purpose of reaching the lost. After receiving a phone call from friends who lived near Davison, the McCool’s visited the area and God placed a burden on Pastor Jeff to leave the evangelistic field and pioneer Davison’s first Apostolic Church.

The rest is history. Point of Grace is currently experiencing growth and is spending it’s resources on advertising and evangelizing the City of Davison.

POGM is currently looking to purchase their first building and becoming a permanent presence in the city of Davison.
