Title: Metaphysical Cops

Lyrics: For David Kato

'In sport, the young throw stones at frogs; the frogs die in earnest' - Bion of Borysthenes

From Lake Forest pulpits To the Dark Continent They’re speaking of culprits Of will and intent

My love makes me holy With this laying of hands My desire turns slowly To a prayer for this land

Your theology crumbles For it’s God we appease You know you can’t stumble When you’re down on your knees

Your law and your justice Are ordained in your mind You don’t know what lust is It’s a law more refined

They fear to go to sleep for they fear bad dreams

If you’re losing it here Take the fight overseas With a new ship to steer And a new flock to feed

‘Human rights’: a tautology It stinks like a corpse It’s the stench of the colony And it’s come back in force

There’s sin in their semen This laying of hands Casts out the demons In a prayer for this land

Our sex makes us humble My God, we’re eager to please You know you can’t stumble When you’re down on your knees
